# Welcome to MUSIC ðŸŽµ

**Notice**: This project is a personal initiative to create a feature-rich music player app. It is currently in the development phase and may not be fully functional. Feel free to explore, test, and share feedback!
This application fetches downloaded audio files that are already in your device.

Thank you for visiting my repository! ðŸ˜Š This app is designed to:

- Offer a smooth and responsive music playback experience.
- Provide customization options for playlists and themes.
- Serve as a portfolio piece showcasing my Android development skills.
